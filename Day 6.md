```sql
select FirstName,DATEDIFF(YEAR,StartDate,GETDATE())
FROM EmployeeData;
```
### Task 5 
Calculate Annual Salary Increase  
-- Assume a yearly salary increase of 3% for each employee.   
-- Write a query to calculate their new salary rounded to the nearest whole number.

```


## Equi Join, Natural Join, Inner Join

## Natural Join
- Works only when the key joining two tables have same `Column name`
- Doesn't have any conditions
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee
NATURAL JOIN department;
```

## Equi Join
- Condition always `=` and not like <,>,<=,>=
```sql
SELECT * FROM employee e
INNER JOIN department d
ON e.emp_id=d.emp_id;
```

## Inner Join (with other than =)

```sql
[10:32 AM] Ragav Kumar V (Unverified)
CREATE TABLE Employees (

    EmployeeID INT,

    Name VARCHAR(50),

    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),

    DepartmentID INT

);
 
CREATE TABLE Departments (

    DepartmentID INT,

    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),

    MinSalary DECIMAL(10,2)

);
 
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000, 101), (2, 'Jane Smith', 40000, 102);

INSERT INTO Departments VALUES (101, 'HR', 45000), (102, 'Marketing', 35000);
 
Select * from Employees
 
Select * from Departments
 
 
Select Name, Salary, DepartmentName,  MinSalary

From Employees

Inner Join Departments 

on Salary > MinSalary
```

## Create Database with command
```sql
CREATE DATABASE fun;  --Creating
USE fun;     --Switching

Exec sp_renamedb 'fun','cool';         --Renaming

DROP DATABASE cool;   --Drop
```

## Limiting
- Offset is a must while doing limit

### Task 1: To display top 3 purchases

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM orders
ORDER BY purch_amt DESC
OFFSET 0 ROWS
FETCH NEXT 3 ROWS ONLY;Â  
```

### Task 2: Format Date - 25 Apr 2012
-- Clue: String Functions - Fromat
```sql
SELECT *,FORMAT(Ord_date,'dd MMM yyyy')
FROM orders;
```

## Variable Declaration
```sql
Format :  Declare @variableName <Data Type> = <Value>
```
```sql
DECLARE @d DATE = GETDATE();
SELECT FORMAT(@d,'dd/MM/yyy','en-us');
```

### Task: Modify the statement - Asking new user then number of rows

```sql
DECLARE @t INT = 3;
SELECT *, FORMAT(ord_date, 'dd MMM yyyy')
FROM orders 
Order by purch_amt desc
    OFFSET 0 ROWS  
    FETCH NEXT @t ROWS ONLY;
```

## SET OPERATIONS
- Union
- Intersect - common
- Except - un common   (Order Matters)

### Database
```sql
Create database setoperations;
use setoperations

 
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50)
);
 
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Department) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Engineering'),
(2, 'Bob', 'Marketing'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Engineering'),
(4, 'Dana', 'HR');
 
 
CREATE TABLE Applicants (
    ApplicantID INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    AppliedFor VARCHAR(50)
);
 
INSERT INTO Applicants (ApplicantID, Name, AppliedFor) VALUES
(5, 'George', 'Engineering'),
(6, 'Helen', 'Marketing'),
(7, 'Ian', 'Marketing'),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Sales');
 
Select * from Employees;
Select * from Applicants;
```
### INTERSECT 
- Gives only the unique value present in both table
- It provides common

```sql
SELECT Department from Employees
INTERSECT
SELECT AppliedFor from Applicants
```

### UNION
- Gives all the unique values present in both table
```sql
SELECT Department from Employees
UNION
SELECT AppliedFor from Applicants
```
### EXCEPT
- Gives only the values that presents in table 1 and not table 2
- It provides difference
- Only here order matters i.e, which statement to put before and after the EXCEPT

```sql
SELECT Department from Employees
EXCEPT
SELECT AppliedFor from Applicants
```
### Task 1: List all distinct products that are either in stock or have been ordered.
```SQL
select productname from Products where InStock like 'yes'
UNION
SELECT productname FROM Products where ProductID in (select ProductID from Orders)
```

### Task 2: Identify products that are both in stock and have been ordered 
```SQL
select productname from Products where InStock like 'yes'
INTERSECT
SELECT productname FROM Products where ProductID in (select ProductID from Orders)
```

### Task 3: Find products that are in stock but have never been ordered.
```SQL
select productname from Products where InStock like 'yes'
EXCEPT
SELECT productname FROM Products where ProductID in (select ProductID from Orders)
```

## DATABASE KEY
1. Primary key
2. Foreign key
3. Composite key
4. Alternate key 
5. Candidate key - They have potential to be primary key
6. Super key - Combination of keys that uniquely identifies a record
- They must be
    - Unique 
    - Not NULL

## ACID PRINCIPLE
A - Atomicity  
C - Consistency  
I - Isolation  
D - Durability  

- Good database is identified by ACID properties

# COMPOUND SORTING

### Task 1: sort based on region and further sort based on amount in region
```sql
select * from EmployeeSales
order by region,SalesAmount desc;
```
# COMPOUND GROUPING 

### Task 2: 
```sql
select Region,Category,SUM(SalesAmount) from EmployeeSales
group by Region,Category
order by region,Category desc;
```

# GROUPING SETS

-- Grouping sets - R-C,R-Q,R,Q
```sql
select Region,Category,Quarter,SUM(SalesAmount) from EmployeeSales
group by GROUPING SETS(
				(Region,Category),
				(Region,Quarter),
				Region,Quarter
)
Order by GROUPING(Region),GROUPING(Category),GROUPING(Quarter)
